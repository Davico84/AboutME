## Hey! 👋

I'm David, a 39 year old Peruvian web developer. 
I am a Systems Engineer by profession, and for many years I have been interested in the world of computers.

During my experience I moved away from the world of software development and got into mining technology projects. But since I met Henry my preferences turned to the development of Full Stack applications.

I am currently looking for job offers that satisfy my desire to apply what I have learned and acquire new knowledge and tools that allow me to develop good quality software.
